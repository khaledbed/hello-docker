# Docker Security Best Practices

**Step 1: Introduction to Docker Security Best Practices**
Ensure the security of your Docker environment by following best practices and implementing proper security measures.

**Step 2: Running Containers with Least Privileges**
Avoid running containers as root. Use non-root users whenever possible.
Example command: `docker run -u 1000:1000 my_image`

**Step 3: Controlling Container Capabilities**
Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities for containers.
Example command: `docker run --cap-drop=NET_RAW my_image`

**Step 4: Securing Docker Daemon Socket**
Limit access to the Docker daemon socket for increased security.
Example: Configure `daemon.json` with `'unix:///var/run/docker.sock'` and `'127.0.0.1:2375'`.

**Step 5: Using Docker Content Trust**
Enable Docker Content Trust to verify the authenticity and integrity of images.
Example command: `export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1`

**Step 6: Implementing Image Scanning**
Use image scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in your Docker images.
Example: Utilize third-party tools like Clair or Docker Security Scanning.

**Step 7: Regularly Updating Base Images**
Keep your Docker images and base images up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
Example command: `docker pull my_base_image:latest`

**Step 8: Securing Docker Compose Files**
Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in Docker Compose files. Use environment variables or Docker secrets.
Example snippet:
```yaml
services:
  my_service:
    image: my_image
    environment:
      - SECRET_KEY`


**Step 9: Network Segmentation for Services**
Use Docker overlay networks and network segmentation to control service communication.
Example command: `docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay_network`

**Step 10: Container Resource Limits**
Set resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers to prevent resource abuse.
Example command: `docker run --cpus=0.5 --memory=512m my_image`

**Step 11: Monitoring and Logging**
Implement monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents.
Example: Utilize tools like Prometheus for monitoring and ELK stack for logging.

**Step 12: Implementing Network Policies**
Use network policies to control traffic between containers and services.
Example: Kubernetes Network Policies or third-party solutions like Calico.

**Step 13: Regular Security Audits**
Conduct regular security audits of your Docker environment to identify and address vulnerabilities.
Example: Use tools like Docker Bench for Security for automated security checks.

**Step 14: Applying Principle of Least Privilege**
Apply the principle of least privilege to limit access and permissions for users and containers.

**Step 15: Docker Host Security**
Secure the underlying host system by keeping it updated, using firewalls, and applying host-level security measures.

**Step 16: Cleanup - Review and Update Security Measures**
Regularly review and update security measures based on the evolving threat landscape.
